The survey will take about 20 minutes, and will ask basic knowledge questions, as well as opinions and some demographic questions. Don't worry about getting any knowledge questions wrong, attempt them to the best of your ability; they're there to obtain a conclusion as to if the experience is effective at teaching.

Thank you!
