Epidemiological is a epidemiology/clinical microbiology virtual escape room with the purpose of educating undergraduate microbiologists about the various biochemical tests that can be done to identify pathogens, as well as what an epidemiologist does. It can take about an hour to complete. Any resemblances to real places or people is completely coincidental, and any currencies, people or places mentioned in the escape room are completely fictitious.

(The escape room does contain basic audio. Feel free to mute it as it is not compulsory to the experience, but provides basic prompts to actions that are occurring.)

Do not feel pressured to complete the whole virtual escape room if you do not have the time, but please still fill in the Questionnaire after attempting, regardless if you got to the end or not. Please do not fill in the survey until you have at least attempted the virtual escape room.

<a href="https://strathsci.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9WGMkDJ7oGBHrfg">Complete the Survey</a>

The survey will take about 20 minutes, and will ask knowledge questions, as well as opinions and some basic demographic questions. Don't worry about getting any knowledge questions wrong; attempt them to the best of your ability; they're there to obtain a conclusion as to if the experience is effective at teaching.

Thank you very much for your time!
