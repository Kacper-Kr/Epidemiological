This project is intended to find out if gamification of learning material is an effective revision resource, or substitute for traditional teaching (Didactics) specifically in the teaching of Undergraduate Microbiology, conducted at University of Strathclyde.

Participation is entirely voluntary, and information is only collected using the survey (No information is stored while playing the virtual escape room provided, after it is completed).

In the survey, you will be asked to answer some basic demographic questions (Age, Gender, and how familiar you are with various biomolecular sciences), knowledge questions that test some of the content presented in the virtual escape room - Try your best, but don't worry about getting things wrong - and lastly you will be asked about various opinions regarding the virtual escape room to improve the process in the future. Although we hope you are able to answer all questions, do abstain from questions you are not comfortable answering.

This information is intended to, first, identify if Gamification of learning material is effective at teaching (Hence the knowledge questions), draw any links about how certain demographics are likely to engage with the resource, and any way the process can be improved if it is used in the future.

The resource is intended as revision and consolidation material for Undergraduate Microbiologists, however anyone can participate if they desire.

Anything submitted into the survey will be collected and used to draw conclusions, however this information is anonymous and due to the vagueness of the demographic questions you will not be able to be identified. 
By attempting to the survey you agree to your information being used in this study.

Only me and my project supervisor will have access to the information collected, and will only be kept for the duration it is necessary.
